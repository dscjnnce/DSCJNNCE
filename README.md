README PROJECT-1 FSD
As this is the first project of DSC JNNCE  so our project team manager Abhishek J M setup certain guidelines for Research, Communication, UI/UX and Web Development team. He stuck to the motive Research what are all the various categories to be added to DSC JNNCE website. He handled it gracefully till deployment of the website.

Research Team:
•	Research lead Yashas Vinay guided his team members Gowri H R and Abhishek J M. They mutually decided whether to go for static website or dynamic one and also they look up to the hosting services. Later on they go through the contents of the website and found 7 pages should be include in the website i.e. Home, Videos, Blogs, Solution Challenge (Eureka), Our Feed, Team and Contact us . Every page has its own uniqueness once you go through the website you’ll find. All of them had the intention to use the colors in such way that it should be perfectly visible to the people suffering from any kind of color blindness. Then, they explained all that necessary information to the UI/UX team so that they can get brief idea of how the website should look and what all are the important things to be taken into consideration while designing the website and also communicated with the communication team to give them the idea of what are the contents should they write about each page. Finally, we discussed with the Web development team about how the website has to be coded considering all the above points.

Communication Team:
•	The Communication lead is Shrestha S Bharadwaj. She guided her team fully from what to do to how to do. She distributed the writing among her team members Sinchana K O and Harshita Pengoria. Communication team dealt with Meta description, articles on DSC-JNNCE, readme part for github, questions for feedback and contact page of website and Blog on full stack development.
Web Development Team:
•	The coding of the website is done by web development lead Ananya Kumar and his team including Shashank Gs, Chetna Prabhu, Nidhishree MP and Aishwarya G S. The lead handle all his responsibilities and took care of his team by hosting continuous meetings, did SWOT analysis and if someone has errors in his code they all debug it together. Time to time lead also gave some references to the members if they stuck somewhere.

UI/UX TEAM: 
•	As per the given information from the research team the entire UI-UX team with lead as Abhishek MN has got up the best designs for the website by creating the designs as per the instructions of color topography with the coordination of his entire team Sudhvina A S, Sushvina A S,  Rakshita and Neha A Gingade along with the help of people from other teams Anupa Kini, Arpitha A G and Sinchana K O. They all joined the hands and bought out the best design and reached all the expectations. They created a team board on miro and rolled off with mapping out the pages of website, creating work flows and moved on to paper prototyping and then finalize them. The tool they used for converting those paper drawings into beautiful designs was invision studio. After the usability testing, they handed over the designs to coding team.


README PROJECT-2 DIALOGFLOW
As DSC-JNNCE lead Yeshwanth P suggested, the second project will be a chatbot using dialogflow.
By following his instructions our project management lead Abhishek J M took the responsibility to make all DSC members understand what dialogflow is and how it works. It took almost 2 – 3 sessions to understand dialogflow and its working. The interesting part about this project this that we work irrespective of our teams and I think that was the exciting part .
INTENT CREATORS: Here, we worked in a quite different manner .The intent questions were created by UI/UX team, Marketing team and Research team. The intents were mainly focused on COVID-19 related queries and about the chatbot itself.
The intents were answered by communication team in order to distribute work accordingly. Coding has no part in this as we used dialogflow. Also one article on full functioning of dialogflow was given by communication team
DEPLOYMENT: The deployment of chatbot is performed by Yashas Vinay, Neha A Gingade and Gowri H R in a live open seminar. You can watch it on youtube also ………(provide the link if session is recorded).
PROMOTION: We would like to thank our Marketing lead Arpitha Ag and Graphic Designing lead Anupa Kini and their team members to promote the event by making eye catchy posters and banners and upload them on DSC-JNNCE social media.
